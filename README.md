# Location-Based-Restaurants-Recommendation-System
These days reviews play vital role in every individualâ€™s life. It helps in choosing the best product or service. They have enhanced the probability of buying the right product, going to a good movie, eating at the best restaurant etc. But sometimes they could mislead a user in making a bad choice if he/she has opposite tastes when compared to the user who has written the review. So to overcome this problem we have developed a system, which helps the user in choosing the right restaurant according to his/her requirements.  Apache Zookeeper, Apache Kafka servers are used to stream our static data. Inverted index have been created in Elasticsearch and visualized using Kibana. 

Synopsis Of the Project:

Our work comprises of two recommendation systems in which, one uses the Static data and other uses the real time streaming data.

Problem Of Existing System:

To withstand the high competition, restaurants try to improve their quality to satisfy their customers. We processed tips data on daily basis through streaming and recommended top restaurants to the user.

Solution Of the Problem:

Our systems were experimented on Yelp dataset and the results. Java, Scala and Python were used for accomplishing the project.
