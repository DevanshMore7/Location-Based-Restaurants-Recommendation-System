These days reviews play vital role in every individualâ€™s life. It helps in choosing the best product or service. They have enhanced the probability of buying the right product, going to a good movie, eating at the best restaurant etc. But sometimes they could mislead a user in making a bad choice if he/she has opposite tastes when compared to the user who has written the review. So to overcome this problem we have developed a system, which helps the user in choosing the right restaurant according to his/her requirements.  Apache Zookeeper, Apache Kafka servers are used to stream our static data. Inverted index have been created in Elasticsearch and visualized using Kibana.
